  desc: Number of cells belonging to each annotated cell type across all organs for FACS and microfluidic droplets.
- name: Supplementary Table 2
  desc: Cell type comparisons and lists of differentially expressed genes common between methods (FACS, droplet, microwell-Seq).
- name: Supplementary Table 3
  desc: Random forest results for simultaneously defining all cell types with TF expression. This table consists of 4 tabs. The first tab summarizes the most important variables for the model. The second tab indicates all the unique cell types being classified. To build this model we used a data subset of 10 cells for each of the unique cell types. The third tab contains the classification confusion matrix and the fourth tab the summary of the average classification error per cell type.
- name: Supplementary Table 4
  desc: Random forest results for defining each individual cell type with TF expression. In this model, each unique cell type (112 total) was compared to all other cell types. The numbers are the mean decrease Gini score. The value NA in each cell means that the transcription factor corresponding to that row does not contribute the classification model of the cell corresponding to that column.
